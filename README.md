# Klarta Humea Integration with Home Assistant via ESP32 and MQTT

This project enables integration of the Klarta Humea humidifier with Home Assistant using an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 communicates with the humidifier via UART and interfaces with Home Assistant through MQTT. This allows you to control and monitor your Klarta Humea humidifier directly from Home Assistant, bypassing the faulty Local Tuya integration.
